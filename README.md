# Job-Searcher
This is a web scraping and natural language processing algorithm that helps applicants find the jobs they're looking for.

## How it works
The web scraping algorithm created with Scrapy and BeautifulSoup, scrapes all job data (for jobs in California cities) from Indeed's main website. The Spacy NLP library is then used to extract information from the scraped data, including job salary, location, and a summary of main duties and qualifications.
